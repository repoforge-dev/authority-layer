# AuthorityLayer

[![CI](https://github.com/032383justin/authority-layer/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/032383justin/authority-layer/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Hard execution and budget limits for autonomous agents — enforced locally.

AuthorityLayer prevents runaway spend, infinite tool loops, and uncontrolled external calls in agentic systems. It enforces strict boundaries inside your runtime and halts execution safely when limits are breached.

No telemetry.  
No cloud dependency.  
Fail-closed by default.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install authority-layer
```

Verify the install in seconds:

```bash
npx authority-layer doctor
```

Expected output:

```
AuthorityLayer Doctor  authority-layer@0.1.0

  ✔  Node.js version >= 18                  pass
  ✔  crypto module (sha256)                 pass
  ✔  AUTHORITY_LAYER_DISABLE not set        pass
  ✔  core module loads offline              pass
  ✔  AuthorityLayer instantiates            pass

All checks passed. AuthorityLayer is ready.
```

See a live enforcement halt:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/032383justin/authority-layer.git
cd authority-layer && npm install && npm run example
```

```
⛔  Execution halted

## Why AuthorityLayer Exists

Autonomous agents introduce a new risk surface:

- Unbounded token spend  
- Infinite tool loops  
- Retry storms  
- Cascading API calls  
- Silent cost explosions  

Most systems rely on warnings or provider-level quotas.

AuthorityLayer enforces hard limits directly in your execution loop.

When a boundary is crossed, execution stops.

---

## Core Guarantees

- Local-first enforcement (works offline)
- Fail-closed by default
- Structured halts (never crashes the process)
- Tamper-evident hash-linked event chain
- Zero outbound calls unless explicitly configured

---

## Installation

```bash
npm install authority-layer
```
